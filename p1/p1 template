<h2> Problem Definition </h2>
<p>
Give a concise description of current problem. For instance, what
needs to be solved and why it is useful?  Do you make any assumptions?
What are the difficulties?<br><br>

"Your team will design and implement algorithms that delineate hand shapes or gestures, 
and create a graphical display that responds to the recognition of the hand shapes or gestures."
</p>

<hr>
<h2> Method and Implementation </h2>
<p>
Give a concise description of the implemented method. For example, you might describe the 
motivation of current idea, the algorithmic steps or any formulation used in current method.<br>
<br>
We used thresholding and contour recognition to find the bounding boxes to recognize hand shapes.
The specific hand shapes that we were looking for were a fist, a flat hand, and a peace sign for the game Rock, Paper, Scissors.
First we gray out the frame, and then blur out the gray image.  Then we used thresholding to find the main hand shape.
We then used contour recognition to contour that main hand shape and create a bounding box around that shape.  Depending on the shape of the box,
a different graphic would appear as a response.  A square box would indicate a fist and the AI would respond with a paper image.  A vertical rectangle
would indicate a peace sign and the AI would respond with a rock image.  A horizontal rectangle would indicate a flat hand and the AI would respond with a scissors image.
</p>

<p>
Briefly outline the functions you created in your code to carry out your algorithmic steps described above.<br><br>

Frame gray:<br>
Convert image to gray<br><br>

Blur frame:<br>
Blur the image<br><br>

Thresholding:<br>
Convert into binary image using thresholding<br><br>

Find contours:<br>
Method given to us in Lab 3<br><br>

Draw contours:<br>
Draws the contours in the screen and fills in the hand<br><br>

Rectangle:<br>
Draw a rectangle around the contours<br><br>

Logic section:<br>
determines the hand shape based on the attributes of the rectangle<br><br>
</p>

<hr>
<h2>Experiments</h2>
<p>
Describe your experiments, including the number of tests that you
performed, and the relevant parameter values.  <br><br>

We had to test our AI often in the process of development.<br><br>
Test one:<br>
We pointed webcam in an uncontrolled background. <br><br>

Test two:<br>
Consistent black background with white sleeve.<br><br>

Test tree:<br>
Consistent black background with black sleeve.<br><br>

Several tests were conducted in each environment.<br><br>

</p>
<p>
Define your evaluation<br><br> 

Accuracy: <br>
0/1<br>
0 for negative, failed detection<br>
1 for positive, correct detection and analysis
</p>


<hr>
<h2> Results</h2>
<p>
List your experimental results.  Provide examples of input images and output
images. If relevant, you may provide images showing any intermediate steps <br>
Note: Trial pictures are in folder with bu logo.

<h2> Discussion </h2>

<p> 
Discuss your method and results:
</p><ul>
<li>What are the strengths and weaknesses of your method? <br><br>

Strengths: Simple design, easy to use algorithms<br>
Weaknesses: only works with a black background, obvious lag<br><br>
</li>
<li>Do your results show that your method is generally successful or
     are there limitations? Describe what you expected to find in your
     experiments, and how that differed or was confirmed by your
     results. <br><br>
	 
	 The AI can only recognize the gestures that we specified; however with those three, the algorithms are very accurate in delineating hand shapes.
	 <br><br>
	 </li>
<li>Potential future work. How could your method be improved?   What
would you try (if you had more time) to overcome the
failures/limitations of your work?<br><br>

Increase our span of gestures and eliminate the lighting restrictions.
</li> 
</ul>
<p></p>

<hr>
<h2> Conclusions </h2>

<p>
Based on your discussion, what are your conclusions?  What is your
main message?<br><br>
AIs have a lot of potential, but we wished we were more experienced with C++ that way we could have expanded the capabilities of our AI.
 
</p>

<h2> Credits and Bibliography </h2>
<p>

Cite any papers or other references you consulted while developing
your solution.  Citations to papers should include the authors, the
year of publication, the title of the work, and the publication
information (e.g., book name and publisher; conference proceedings and
location; journal name, volume and pages; technical report and
institution).  Material on the web should include the url and date of
access.<br><br>
Lab 2, Lab 3, stackOverflow
</p>

<p>
Credit any joint work or discussions with your classmates. <br><br>
